#  🌐 Landing page Practice Project

A simple landing page built as a **hands-on practice exercise** to strengthen my front-end fundamentals and learn how to **deploy a static website using GitHub Pages**.

This project focuses on writing clean HTML/CSS, structuring a basic layout, and publishing it as a live site using GitHub’s built-in hosting.
